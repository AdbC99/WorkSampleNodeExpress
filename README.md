# WorkSampleNodeExpress

This is a small project showing a basic express server that can handle a basic user input

## Available Scripts

To get started clone the repository and then in the root run

`npm install`

Once that has completed then you can either start serving the app by typing:

`npm start`

A single unit test is given (rather than demonstrating complete coverage) and can be run using:

`npm test`
